# MonoGameEngine

Here is an awful start to a game engine. Check out my other pieces to it:
* todo, add links
* Physics
* Renderer
* Scripting Language
* Math
* AI components
* Networking Lib (did I mention it's going to be fully collaborative?)
* If you read this far, then you're probably pretty cool. hmu

One day I will create a full game engine, you will see.
